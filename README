This package is running with the NEURON simulation program written by Michael
Hines and available on internet at:
  http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/
  http://neuron.duke.edu/

The package contains mechanisms (.mod files) and programs (.oc files) needed
to simulate different models of thalamocortical (TC) relay neurons, relative
to the paper:

  PROGRAMS
  ========

tc1_cc.o c  : current clamp in 1-compartment TC cell
tc3_cc.oc   : current clamp in 3-compartment TC cell
tc200_cc.oc : current clamp in 200-compartment TC cell (intact cell)
tc200_vc.oc : voltage clamp in 200-compartment TC cell (intact cell)
tcD_cc.oc   : current clamp in 8-compartment TC cell (dissociated cell)
tcD_vc.oc   : voltage clamp in 8-compartment TC cell (dissociated cell)


  MECHANISMS
  ==========

 hh2.mod		: fast sodium spikes (Na and K currents)
 ITGHK.mod		: T-type calcium current of TC cells
 cadecay.mod		: intracellular calcium dynamics
 VClamp.mod		: mechanism for single-electrode voltage-clamp


  HOW TO RUN
  ==========

Use autolaunch on modeldb or:

unix platform:

  To compile the demo, NEURON and INTERVIEWS must be installed and working on
  the machine you are using.  Just type "nrnivmodl" to compile the mechanisms
  given in the mod files.

  Then, execute the main demo program by typing:

  nrngui mosinit.hoc

mswin platform:

  Compile the mechanism (mod) files by using mknrndll.  Then start the simulation
  by clicking on mosinit.hoc in windows explorer.

back to any platform:

Once the menu and graphics interface has appeared, click on a simulation from
the Simulations of TC cells window.  Then click on "Init and Run"
button to start the simulation on the RunControl window.  If you do not see a RunControl
window you can bring it to the front by selecting it under Tools from the NEURON main menu.
